      <h2>What are Color Meanings?</h2>
      <p>
        Color meanings, also known as color symbolism or color psychology, is
        the study of how colors affect human emotions and behavior. It is based
        on the idea that colors can evoke different emotions and moods in
        people, and that by understanding these associations, we can use colors
        more effectively in design, marketing, and even personal branding.

        Color meanings can vary across different cultures and contexts, but
        there are some common associations that are widely recognized. For
        example, red is often associated with passion, energy, and love, while
        blue is often associated with trust, peace, and tranquility.
